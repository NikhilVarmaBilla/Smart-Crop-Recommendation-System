# Smart-Crop-Recommendation-System
AI/ML project that recommends suitable crops based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions using Random Forest algorithm.
# Smart Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project uses Machine Learning to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

The system uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict crops with high accuracy.

This project helps farmers make better decisions and improve agricultural productivity.
